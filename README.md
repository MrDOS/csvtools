# CSVTools

CSVs are hard.
Make your life easier.

## Concept

The field and record separator characters
used by the CSV format
(`,` and `\n`, respectively)
can
(and very often do)
appear within the field contents.
In turn,
tools which interact with CSVs
must have the ability
to quote these characters
(and in turn escape the quotes)
when encoding to CSV,
and to unquote/unescape
when decoding them.
This hamstrings numerous utilities
(mostly `cut` and `awk`)
which expect
a single delimiting character.

Here's the trick:
ASCII defines four characters,
`1C` through `1F`,
as the file, group, record, and unit separator characters.
These are non-printable,
binary characters
which do not appear in regular text.
You can probably see
where I'm going with this:
statefully and appropriately
replace `,` with `\x1E`
and `\n` with `\x1F`,
perform your processing
with ordinary, record- and field-oriented tools
with slightly extraordinary delimiters,
then encode back
to boring old
(but correct)
CSV when finished.
So that's what this project is.

This project also includes
some general tools
for getting CSV data into and out of Excel.
Excel has its own beliefs
about how CSVs should work
which don't necessarily coincide
with those held
by the rest of the civilized world.

## The Tools

### `csvsplit(1)`

Takes CSV content via stdin,
performs the replacements described above,
and writes to stdout.

### `csvjoin(1)`

Does the opposite of `csvsplit(1)`:
given a `\x1E`/`\x1F`-delimited data stream,
it outputs well-escaped CSV data.

### `cawk`/`cawkin`

These are convenience wrappers
around `awk(1)`.
`cawkin` unmarshals CSV content
from stdin into awk
invoked with the flags necessary
for field and record
separation on the special characters.
`cawk` takes this a step further
by rigging things up
so the output is also valid, escaped CSV data
in case your awk
program doesn't format data
for human consumption
or input for another program.

Both of these wrappers
accept typical awk arguments
(e.g., accepting a program
given as an argument
or using `-f` to point at a program file)
or can be used
as the shebang
of an executable awk program
(i.e., `#! /usr/bin/env cawk -f`).

### `csv2xlsx`

Creates an Excel XLSX workbook
from one or more CSV files.
Each CSV is imported
as a separate worksheet.

Requires `python3` and the [XlsxWriter module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/XlsxWriter)
(try `pip3 install xlsxwriter`).

### `csvfix`

Excel for Mac provides two CSV output formats,
both of them terrible.
The tl;dr is that
the “CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited)” format
eats your data
(no, really,
the output can be [complete garbage](http://seeblog.seenet.ca/2017/02/csv-support-in-excel-for-mac-2016-is-a-travesty/))
and should never, ever be used.
Save your data
as “Comma Separated Values (.csv)”
then run it through `csvfix`
to fix the encoding
and line endings.

Requires `iconv(1)`, `perl`, and `sed`.

### `excelify`

Make a UTF-8 CSV suitable
for import into Excel
by prepending a UTF-8 BOM
and replacing newlines within fields
with carriage returns.

Requires `cawk`.

## Building

To compile `csvsplit(1)` and `csvjoin(1)`:

    $ make

This should work
just about anywhere
that you can find a C compiler.

If you'd like to compile for development
(with warnings and debug symbols),
the `debug` target has your back:

    $ make debug
